## About
MarioBrosGame is an attempted recreation (with some new touches) of the Super Mario Bros. 3 game on the NES.

This game is coded in Java using the Eclipse IDE and [Stanford's acm library](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/jtf/), more specifically the [acm.graphics package](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/jtf/rationale/GraphicsPackage.html).

This is an ongoing project from Feb 5th, 2023 - Now

## How to play the game on your computer
